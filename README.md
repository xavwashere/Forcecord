# Installation

You will need a few things in order to install Forcecord:
First of all, install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org), and run `npm install -g asar`. Next, install [Python](https://python.org). Once Python is installed, run `pip install requests`. Python is only used to run the installer though. You don't need Python if you are going to be manually installing.
You'll also need [WinRAR](https://winrar.com). Make sure to click Download instead of Buy!

There are two ways you can go from here:
You can either run the installer (check the releases section) or manually install Forcecord.
